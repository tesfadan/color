# Color Bot

Color Bot is a colour scheme generating/sharing Web App. Users can generate colour schemes out of photos and videos. It uses **Vibrant.js** _https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant_ to extract prominent colours from an image and presents two schemes for the user to pick. The schemes are then saved on the database and available for anyone to use.
<br>
Users can copy the color code by simply clicking on the color they like.

<br><br>

## Roadmap

- Ability to adjust colors Before saving
- Generate more schemes using machine learning model
- Check and improve accessibility
