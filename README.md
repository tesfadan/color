# Modern Color

Modern Color is a web application I built to create and store color schemes for my design work. It uses Vibrant.js to extract prominent colors from an image. It also incorporates Brain.js to check for contrast values for a better user experience. The color schemes are saved for anyone to access from anywhere.

## Roadmap

- Ability to adjust colors Before saving
- Generate more schemes using machine learning model
- Improve accessibility
