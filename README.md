# Modern Color

Modern Color _[https://moderncolor.cc]_ is a color scheme generating/sharing web app. Its uses **Vibrant.js** _[https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant]_</b> to extract prominent colors from an image and presents two schemes for the user to pick. The schemes are then saved on **Googles's Firestore Database** _[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@firebase/firestore]_ if the user chosses to do so.
<br>
Users can copy the color code by simply clicking on the color they like.

<br><br>

## Roadmap

- Ability to adjust colors Before saving
- Generate more schemes using machine learning model
- Improve accessibility
